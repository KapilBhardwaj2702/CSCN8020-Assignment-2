## Overview

This assignment implements and analyzes the **Q-Learning algorithm** using the **Taxi-v3** environment from Gymnasium.  
The goal is to understand how the **learning rate (α)** and **exploration rate (ε)** affect the agent’s ability to learn an optimal policy.

The implementation follows the assignment requirements:

* Baseline run with α=0.1, ε=0.1, γ=0.9  
* Experiments varying α ∈ [0.01, 0.001, 0.2]  
* Experiments varying ε ∈ [0.2, 0.3]  
* Reported metrics: total episodes, average return, and average steps per episode  
* Learning curves and summary tables are plotted automatically
